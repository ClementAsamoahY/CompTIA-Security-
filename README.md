# CompTIA-Security-
Certified By Comptia
The completion of this course, its exams and finally being certified is the first of many in my never-ending learning path in Cybersecurity. 
I have gained knowledge in how to identify and address potential threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities and they have established techniques in risk management, risk mitigation, threat management, and intrusion detection.
